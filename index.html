    <h4 id="ward">A gentle introduction to cryptographic group actions</h4>

    <p>Exponentiation in groups has been the workhorse of public-key
      cryptography since 1976, it gives us DH key-exchange, PKE's,
      signatures, and much more. Unfortunately, the reign of
      exponentiation is coming to an end because of Schor's quantum
      algorithm. Since 2018, we have an efficient instantiation of a
      new building block: The cryptographic group action. This talk
      gives a brief introduction to (isogeny-based) cryptographic
      group actions, and we explore the similarities and
      differences with exponentiation in groups.  No knowledge on
      isogeny-based crypto is required to follow the talk.</p>
    
    <h4 id="luca">Supersingular isogeny graphs, SIDH, etc.</h4>

    <p>I will review the basic facts on the structure of the full
      supersingular isogeny graph over ùîΩ<sub>p¬≤</sub>, as seen in SIDH
      and many other isogeny based protocols.</p>

    <p>I will then spend most of the time explaining what an "SIDH
      square" in the isogeny graph is, an how to use it for key
      exchange, signatures and more.</p>

    <p>Finally, I will point to some active research areas in
      isogeny-based cryptography.</p>
    
    <h4 id="boris">### New adaptive attack on SIDH</h4>

    <p>The SIDH key exchange is the main building block of SIKE. In
      2016, Galbraith et al. (GPST) presented an adaptive attack on
      SIDH. In this attack, the malicious party manipulates the
      torsion points in his public key in order to recover the honest
      party's secret when having access to a key exchange oracle. In
      2017, Petit designed a passive attack (which was improved by de
      Quehen et al. in 2020) that exploits the torsion point
      information available in SIDH public key to recover the secret
      isogeny when the endomorphism ring of the starting curve is
      known.</p>

    <p>In this talk, we present a new adaptive attack on SIDH-type
      schemes that uses torsion point attacks as subroutine.  Our
      attack is different from the GPST adaptive attack in the sense
      that the malicious party does not manipulate the torsion points
      in his public key, but the degree of his secret isogeny. Using
      his access to a key exchange oracle, he recovers the action of
      Alice's secret isogeny on a larger torsion group.  This leads to
      an imbalanced SIDH instance on which the improved torsion points
      attacks run in polynomial time.</p>

    <p>Joint work with Christophe Petit.</p>

    <h4 id="yi-fu">### Group Signatures and More from Isogenies (and
      Lattices): Generic, Simple, and Efficient</h4>

    <p>We construct an efficient dynamic group signature (or more
      generally an accountable ring signature) from isogeny
      assumptions. Our group signature is based on a simple generic
      construction that can be instantiated by cryptographically hard
      group actions such as the CSIDH group action. The signature is
      of size <em>O(log N)</em>, where <em>N</em> is the number of
      users in the group. Our idea builds on the recent efficient
      OR-proof by Beullens, Katsumata, and Pintore (Asiacrypt'20),
      where we efficiently add a proof of valid ciphertext to their
      OR-proof and further show that the resulting non-interactive
      zero-knowledge proof system is online extractable.</p>

    <p>Our group signatures satisfy more ideal security properties
      compared to previously known constructions, while simultaneously
      having an attractive signature size. The signature size of our
      isogeny-based construction is an order of magnitude smaller than
      all previously known post-quantum group signatures (e.g., 6.6 KB
      for 64 members).</p>

    <p>Joint work with Ward Beullens, Samuel Dobson, Shuichi Katsumata
      and Federico Pintore.</p>

    <h4 id="simon">### Cryptanalysis of an Oblivious PRF from Supersingular Isogenies</h4>

    <p>We give a brief introduction on oblivious pseudorandom
      functions (OPRFs). Then, we present two OPRF constructions from
      isogenies ‚Äî based on group actions and on SIDH, respectively ‚Äî
      proposed by Boneh, Kogan and Woo. We cryptanalyse the SIDH-based
      oblivious pseudorandom function by demonstrating an attack on
      one assumption, the auxiliary one-more assumption, underlying
      the security of the scheme. This leads to an attack on the
      oblivious PRF itself. The attack allows adversaries to evaluate
      the OPRF without further interactions with the server after some
      initial OPRF evaluations and (offline) computation. This breaks
      the pseudorandomness of the OPRF.  We first propose a
      polynomial-time attack. Then, we argue it is easy to change the
      OPRF protocol to include some countermeasures, and present a
      second subexponential attack that succeeds in the presence of
      said countermeasures.</p>

    <p>Joint work with Andrea Basso, P√©ter Kutas, Christophe Petit,
      and Antonio Sanso.</p>
